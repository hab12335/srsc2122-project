TLS Protocol: Traffic Analysis 
---------------------------------
This is a PCAP file (format exportd form the Wireshark tool)
used to analyze a TLS connection.
The file (wireshark-clip-tls.pcap) is an excert of te
TLS connection between a computer (remotely used in a
domestic wireless network: 192.168.1.0 mash  255.255.255.0 - Host
address 192.168.1.8, and the Clip System at FCT-UNL: 193.136.126.138.

You can obtain similar traces with different hosts with your wireshark
tool, to capture and analyze any traffic visualization supported by
wireshark.

If you want to see the wireshark-clip-tls.pcap you can also import
it for your wireshark.

Note) pcap is an interoperable format used by many traffic analysis
tools, including for example: tcpdump (a command line tool usually
included in many Linux distros and availabel for download for
many other environments.
